# Popular Movies
This is the second project for Nanodegree Advanced Program

## Project Overview part 1
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. We will split the development of this app in two stages. First, let's talk about stage 1.

##Project Overview part 2
In this second and final stage, you’ll add additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.

You’ll add more information to your movie details view:

You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
You'll create a database and content provider to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
Recall from Stage 1, you built a UI that presented the user with a grid of movie posters, allowed users to change sort order, and presented a screen with additional information on the movie selected by the user:

In this stage you’ll build the core experience of your movies app.

### App will:

* Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
* Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
* The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
* Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  - original title
  - movie poster image thumbnail
  - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  - user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  - release date
	
## Required Tasks Done
* Build a UI layout for multiple Activities.
* Launch these Activities via Intent.
* Fetch data from themovieDB API

## API KEY 
 * Parse you own in to gradle.properties
